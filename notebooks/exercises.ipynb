    "The OPTIMADE specification defines a web-based JSON API that is implemented by many [different materials databases](https://www.optimade.org/providers-dashboard) to allow users to query the underlying data with the same syntax and response format.\n",
    "There are several tools that can access these APIs, for example, any web browser, any programming language that can make HTTP requests, or common command-line tools such as `curl` or `wget`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also specialist tools, developed by members of the OPTIMADE community.\n",
    "You may have heard about three such tools in other tutorials and talks:\n",
    "1. [The Materials Cloud web-based OPTIMADE client](https://dev-tools.materialscloud.org/optimadeclient/).\n",
    "2. [The optimade.science web-based aggregator](https://optimade.science).\n",
    "3. [`pymatgen`'s built-in OPTIMADE client](https://pymatgen.org/pymatgen.ext.optimade.html?highlight=optimade#module-pymatgen.ext.optimade).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these clients can send requests to multiple OPTIMADE providers *simultaneously*, based on programmatic [providers list](https://providers.optimade.org/). \n",
    "You can explore this list at the human-readable [providers dashboard](https://www.optimade.org/providers-dashboard/), where you can see the current OPTIMADE structure count exceeds 17 million!\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wish to familiarise yourselves with the OPTIMADE API by writing your own queries, scripts or code. Some possible options:\n",
    "- Craft (or copy) your own URL queries to a particular OPTIMADE implementation. Some web browsers (e.g., Firefox) will automatically format the JSON response for you (see Exercise 1).\n",
    "- Use command-line tools such as [`curl`](https://curl.se/) or [`wget`](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) to receive data in your terminal, or pipe it to a file. You could use the tool [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to format the JSON response.\n",
    "- Make an appropriate HTTP request from your programming language of choice. For Python, you could use the standard library [urllib.request](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html) or the more ergonomic external library [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/). Some example code for Python is provided in Exercise 1 below. In Javascript, you can just use `fetch(...)` or a more advanced [optimade client](https://github.com/tilde-lab/optimade-client).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are following these tutorials as part of a school or workshop, please do not hesitate to ask about how to get started with any of the above tools!"

    "This aim of this exercise is to familiarise yourself with the OPTIMADE JSON API.\n",
    "In the recent OPTIMADE paper [[1](#ref1)], we provided the number of results to a set of queries across all OPTIMADE implementations, obtained by applying the same filter to the structures endpoint of each database.\n",
    "The filters are:\n",
    "- Query for structures containing a group IV element: `elements HAS ANY \"C\", \"Si\", \"Ge\", \"Sn\", \"Pb\"`.\n",
    "- As above, but return only binary phases: `elements HAS ANY \"C\", \"Si\", \"Ge\", \"Sn\", \"Pb\" AND nelements=2`.\n",
    "- This time, exclude lead and return ternary phases: `elements HAS ANY \"C\", \"Si\", \"Ge\", \"Sn\" AND NOT elements HAS \"Pb\" AND elements LENGTH 3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In your browser, try visiting the links in Table 1 of the OPTIMADE paper [[1](#ref1)] (clickable links in arXiv version [[2](#ref2)]), which is reproduced below.\n",
    "    - Familiarise yourself with the standard JSON:API output fields (`data`, `meta` and `links`).\n",
    "    - You will find the crystal structures returned for the query as a list under the `data` key, with the OPTIMADE-defined fields listed under the `attributes` of each list entry.\n",
    "    - The `meta` field provides useful information about your query, e.g. `data_returned` shows how many results there are in total, not just in the current page of the response (you can check if the table still contains the correct number of entries, or if it is now out of date).\n",
    "    - The `links` field provides links to the next or previous pages of your response, in case you requested more structures than the `page_limit` for that implementation.\n",
    "- Choose one particular entry to focus on: replace the `filter` URL parameter with `/<structure_id>` for the `id` of one particular structure (e.g. `https://example.org/optimade/v1/structures/<structure_id>`).\n",
    "- Explore other endpoints provided by each of these providers. If they serve \"extra\" fields (i.e. those containing the provider prefix), try to find out what these fields mean by querying the `/info/structures` endpoint.\n",
    "- Try performing the same queries with some of the tools listed above, or in scripts of your own design.\n",
