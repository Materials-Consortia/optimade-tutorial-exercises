        "# What is *pymatgen*?\n",
        "\n",
        "[*pymatgen*](https://pymatgen.org) is a materials science analysis code written in the Python programming language. It helps power the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org)'s high-throughput DFT workflows. It supports integration with a wide variety of simulation codes and can perform many analysis tasks such as the generation of phase diagrams or diffraction patterns.\n",

        "# The motivation behind this tutorial\n",
        "\n",
        "**This tutorial is aimed either at:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* People who are already familiar with using *pymatgen* or the Materials Project\n",
        "    * In particular, anyone already using the Materials Project API through the `MPRester`, and who would like to start using the OPTIMADE API in a similar way\n",
        "\n",
        "* People who like using Python and think they might appreciate an interface like the one provided by *pymatgen*.\n",
        "    * *pymatgen* provides a lot of input/output routines (such as conversion to CIF, POSCAR, etc.) and analysis tools (such as determination of symmetry, analysis of possible bonds, etc.) that can be performed directly on structures retrieved from OPTIMADE providers.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What this tutorial is not:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* This is not necessarily the way everyone should be accessing OPTIMADE providers!\n",
        "    * This tool may be useful to you, or it may not be. There are a lot of good tools available in our community. You are encouraged to try out different tools and find the one that's most useful for your own work.\n",
        "\n",
        "* It is not currently the best way to access OPTIMADE APIs for advanced users.\n",
        "    * It is still under development.\n",
        "    * It is unit tested against several OPTIMADE providers but **some do not work yet**.\n",
        "    * It only currently supports information retrieval from `/v1/structures/` routes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Pre-requisites\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial is aimed at people who already have a basic understanding of Python, including how to import modules, the use of basic data structures like dictionaries and lists, and how to intantiate and use objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you do not have this understanding of Python, this tutorial may help you become familiar, but you are highly encouraged to follow a dedicated Python course such as those provided by [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org)."
